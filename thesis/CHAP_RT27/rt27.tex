 This chapter presents a detailed  numerical analysis of a stator-rotor
 interaction in a typical high pressure (HP) turbine stage of contemporary
 turbomachines using both linear and non linear unsteady flow representations.
 The sources of unsteadiness on the rotor passage are evaluated
 from the steady-state outlet stator solution.
 These disturbances are Fourier transformed and split into
 vortical and potential components in order to assess the
 influence of each on the rotor unsteady aerodynamics.
 The computed results are compared with the experimental data
 measured at the Osney Laboratory's rotating turbine facility.
 Good qualitative, and in most cases quantitative, agreement has
 been obtained.
 In the final part of the chapter, the results of the linearised
 method are compared with those obtained from a non-linear time
 marching technique. There is a surprising overall agreement,
 which indicates that the unsteady flow field generated by
 relative blade motion
 can be considered a quasi linear phenomenon for the HP turbine
 studied.
