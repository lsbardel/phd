 This thesis represents the conclusion of a twenty two year episode
 in my life dedicated almost entirely to formal education.
 In such moment I feel very  fortunate to have
 shared important experiences with so many friends and teachers.
 
 During my permanence at Imperial college I had the pleasure
 to have worked with Dr. Mehmet Imregun who has been a constant
 source of good ideas and guidance as well as letting me the freedom
 of research and travel.
 I would also like to thanks Dr. Mehdi Vahdati, Dr. Naser Sayma and
 Dr. Cirille Br\'{e}ard
 for their support and useful discussions throughout the duration of
 the research project.
