 This Chapter introduces unsteady turbomachinery flows
 and the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods that are currently
 used for simulating such phenomena.
 A comprehensive description of the different unsteady flow phenomena
 is first given. The causes of such phenomena
 and their effects on turbomachinery performance are discussed
 in some detail. The second part the Chapter is focused on
 the application of CFD methodos to simulate
 unsteady turbomachinery flows for forced response prediction.
 Different numerical techniques are described
 together with their assumptions and limitations.
 The last part of the Chapter outlines the objectives
 of the thesis, the approach that will be followed throughout the
 research project and its expected contribution to the field.
